This directory contains scripts for generating each of the figures in the 
manuscript and in the supplementary material. Scripts are prefixed with
"f0x" for Figure x in the main text and "s0x" for Figure x in the 
supplementary material. Most scripts read in data included in the 
repository. Scripts load the BayesianOHC and tidyverse packages in 
the header, although these aren't necessarily needed in every script.
All scripts have the option to be run in "test_mode" which does not
overwrite existing figures.
