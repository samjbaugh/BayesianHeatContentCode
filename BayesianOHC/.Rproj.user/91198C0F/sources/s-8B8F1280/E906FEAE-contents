Description: Code to for fitting non-stationary Gaussian processes to spherical 
    data where a cylindrical representation can be used; intended for quantying
    ocean heat content from Argo floats however most functions are general and
    can be applied to other datasets, particularly on the sphere. Non-stationarity 
    is achieved in each parameter through kernel convolutions, where the parameters 
    are allowed to vary flexibly over space. Gaussian hyper-prior surfaces are 
    used for the  representation of the parameter fields. Any of the parameter 
    fields can be  restricted to stationarity if desired. Code is provided for 
    computing  cross-validation with two different metrics; the first computes 
    validation scores by excluding a window of obversations around each point. 
    The second, leave-one-float-out cross-validation, is intended for Argo data.
